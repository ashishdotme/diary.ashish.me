I have been eating really unhealthy for like 2 years after moving out from home. I don't know why I didn't think it would affect me and I am 81 kg now. -.- But for the past 1 month, I have cut out fried rice, burger, pani-puri, samaso, kachori, paratha, pizza, pasta and have eaten much more healthy. I have also joined gym and trying to eat salad once a day. I am making small small steps to improve my life. :)
