Stateless component in React are components which do not maintain any state.
We can write them in typescript + react in following way.

```javascript
import * as React from 'react'
interface WelcomeProps {
 name: string,
}
const Welcome: React.SFC<WelcomeProps> = (props) => {
 return (<h1>Hello, {props.name} </h1>)
}
```
