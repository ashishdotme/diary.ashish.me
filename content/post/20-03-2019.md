I have done two shopping mistakes this week
1. I bought a tempered glass but didn't realize it was a full edge to edge protection cover so 
it also covers the part around the home button. To my dissapointment, the cover was white and I have a black iPhone 7 :(
2. I ordered a 4ft mini displayport to hdmi cable because I thought 4ft will be too long and it will clutter up my desk. But it turned out to be very small and I already hate it. ughh.
